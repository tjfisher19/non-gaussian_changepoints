# Changepoints in Non-Gaussian Time Series

This repository contains all code to accompany the paper *Multiple Changepoint Detection for Non-Gaussian Time Series*.

The paper includes two implementations to demonstate

* Autocorrelated Beta distributed time series
* Multvariate time series of counts

The Beta distributed case includes a simulation study and analysis of baseball home run proportions in time.  The multvariate counts includes a simulation based on autocorrelated bivariate counts and an analysis of the historic tropical cyclone record.
